In this work, we provide **a computational method of regularized Cox proportional hazards (RCPH) models** for detecting prognostic biomarkers of **breast cancer (BRCA)** from gene expression data. The proposed pipelines of detecting and validating prognostic biomarker genes for BRCA are effective and efficient. Moreover, the proposed **prognostic risk score (PRS)** is very promising as an important indicator for judging the prognosis of BRCA patients.

## Data
<!--START_SECTION:news-->
* In the **Data** file, we give some necessary input/output files by the R codes. Some of these input files only give the first few lines, but this does not affect the results of the work (**CoxReg**).
* In the **Supplementary Material** file, we present the necessary **Additional files** contained in our work.

## R code for CoxReg (i.e., RCPH model in paper)
The **serial number (1), (2), ..., (20)** represents the order in which the program runs in our work. 
<!--START_SECTION:news-->
* (1) TCGA_pro_clin_DE.R  --  First process the data to get the data of all samples. Then select 112 Tumor + 112 Normal samples to get DEGs.
* (2) TCGA_pro_clin_norm.R -- First process the data to get the data of all samples 1080. Then follow 152 dead + 928 alive to get DEGs.
* (3) biomarker_scRNA_mamaprint_KEGG_GO.R -- First integrate prior information (Biomarker 128, scRNA 10, Mamaprint 70, KEGG 147, GO terms). Then combine with RegNatwork to obtain genes with connected structures in the network.
* (4) TCGA_pro_clin_cox_1828_rep20_ridge.R -- Feature selection results of 7 methods, and finally union, 72.
* (5ï¼‰ network_match.R -- Observe the network structure of the union gene.
* (6) net_cor_mi.R -- Enter net_in_inter_genes, integrate cor, increase MI. Then add 15 genes to form a network with 72 genes.
* (7) gene_id_pvalue.R -- Use the P-value of DEG_res_order_TN.csv, two genes are NA.
* (8) feature_select_use.R -- Use the data TCGA_BRCA_clin_1142_1080_scale.txt to extract 72 feature genes of all samples.
* (9) Univariate_cox_for_72.R -- Perform single-factor and multi-factor Cox regression for 72 features, save univariate_cox.csv. According to the multi-factor Cox, obtain the gene and coef of Risk Score.
* (10) TCGA_pro_clin_nomogram.R -- Used to count the clinical information of TCGA, that is, Table 1.
* (11) feature_select_TCGA.R -- Extract coefficients of 3 genes from TCGA_pro_outcome_TN_log.txt, compare between normal and tumor, get box plot.
* (12) feature_select_NEW.R -- Extract univariate_cox_coef.csv data from Independent_data and save it in Data_GEO.
* (13) feature_survival_external_index_NEW.R -- Extract data from Data_GEO and save it to Xtile.
* (14) xtile.R -- Used to get the KM curve based on the threshold obtained by XTile.
* (15) xtile_TCGA.R -- Extract data from TCGA, save it in TCGA_OS_3gene.txt (clinical information + PRS), use the midpoint as cut-off, draw KM curve.
* (16) feature_select_TCGA_NEW.R -- Get expression value of 3 genes, TCGA GSE_TCGA_3_ori.txt. Then get prs_TCGA_for_hiplot.txt, use hiplot to draw.
* (17) timeROC_NEW.R -- Use prs_TCGA_for_hiplot.txt to draw ROC curves for 1, 3, and 5 years on TCGA, optimize coordinate axis and legend.
* (18) cluster.R -- Enrichment result of 72 genes, threshold=0.05, cluster_GO_NEW.csv is obtained.
* (19) Box_sim.R -- Combine results of cluster.R, perform correlation analysis with 23 breast cancer specific GO terms. Select 23 of the top 50 go terms with high correlation and draw a box plot. Get high correlation 6 go terms, return to cluster.R to draw the function.
* (20) GSE42568_expr_box.R -- Process gene expression data, without scale, labeling (text, not 0/1).
